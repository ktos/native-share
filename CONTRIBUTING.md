Contributing to NativeShare
===========================

First of all, thanks for your interest in contributing to NativeShare! :tada:

This project was started as a totally crazy prototype, but I felt it may be
kinda useful, and is actually pretty useful (at least for me)

You are welcome to start contributing!

## Submitting issues
* You can create an issue here, but please include as many details as possible 
with your report, especially if you found a bug,
* You should try to search if a similar issue has already been submitted.

## Creating pull requests
* If you would like to introduce a new feature, some patch, small fix or 
anything else - you are welcome! Fork the repository, push your changes,
create a pull request. If I think the changes are good, I will merge your
PR. If not - you will receive feedback what is wrong and we can work
on resolution,
* Try to maintain coding style already implemented, do not change it,
* All public APIs should be documented and this is checked by StyleCop.

## Branching strategy
* The main development branch (and the default branch for GitHub) is "master",
against which are most commits and pull requests,
* Every release is tagged.
